# Traffic Light Project

This project is a simple implementation of a traffic light using HTML and CSS. It demonstrates the creation and styling of a traffic light structure with two different HTML layouts.

## Project Overview

The project consists of two HTML files and one CSS file:

1. **HTML File 1 (`index.html`)**: 
    - Contains a basic structure for the traffic light with three container divs representing the red, yellow, and green lights.

2. **HTML File 2 (`traffic-light-flexbox.html`)**: 
    - Adds additional divs within each container to simulate a more detailed structure of the traffic light.

3. **CSS File (`style.css`)**: 
    - Styles the traffic light by defining the layout, colors, and dimensions for each light container.

## Project Structure


## Usage

1. **HTML File 1** (`index.html`): 
    - This file displays a simple traffic light with three solid color containers for each light.

2. **HTML File 2** (`traffic-light-flexbox.html`): 
    - This file includes additional elements within each container to simulate the lights more accurately, with different box sizes and positions.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` or `traffic-light-flexbox.html` in your preferred web browser.
3. The traffic light will be displayed in the center of the screen.

## CSS Styling

- The traffic light is centered on the page using Flexbox properties (`display: flex`, `justify-content: center`, and `align-items: center`).
- Each container (`.container-red`, `.container-yellow`, and `.container-green`) has a background color corresponding to the typical traffic light colors.
- Borders are used to simulate the light casing, and additional `box-light-*` divs in `traffic-light-flexbox.html` create more realistic lights.
